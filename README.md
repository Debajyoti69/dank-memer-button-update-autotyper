## This script is compatible with the July 31 2021 button update!!
Just clone the repository to your local device(including the info.txt file) and run it. As simple as that.\
The first time you run the program, the program will prompt you to enter the 5 types of information below:
1. User agent
   - Google search "what is my user agent?" and you will see the results
2. Discord Token
   - See this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI 
3. Discord Channel URL
   - That's the url in the browser address bar when you are currently viewing a text channel.
   - It is in the format: https://discord.com/channels/{a bunch of numbers}/{another bunch of numbers}
4. Discord Server ID
   - This is the first group of numbers in the Discord Channel URL.
   - Eg. if channel url = "https://discord.com/channels/238746123/8937492374" then the server ID would be 238746123
5. Discord Channel ID
   - That's the string of numbers that is at the last part of the Discord Channel URL.
   - Eg. if channel url = "https://discord.com/channels/238746123/8937492374" then the channel ID would be 8937492374\
\[Works in both browser and desktop Discord app\]\
\[You don't have to stay in the Discord window/tab for it to work, this script will not interfere with your keyboard and mouse.\]
